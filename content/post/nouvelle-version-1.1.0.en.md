After the stabilization of the first major version 1.0.0 of RERO ILS ([see release notes](https://github.com/rero/rero-ils/blob/dev/RELEASE-NOTES.rst#v100)), a large part of the resources of the central office and the libraries has been invested in [the migration project](https://rero21.ch/kick-off-du-projet-de-migration-rero-ils/). However, the developments of RERO ILS are far from stopping there. Proof of this is a new version `v1.1.0` whose full release notes are available on [Github](https://github.com/rero/rero-ils/blob/dev/RELEASE-NOTES.rst#v110).
