The work on the future competence centre has begun! On September 13, 2018, the [CIIP](http://www.ciip.ch/ "Site web de la CIIP"), RERO's supervisory authority, [gave the go-ahead](https://www2000.rero.ch/pdfview.php?section=communique&filename=ciip_communique.pdf "CIIP Press release") for the launch of the future library competence and service centre - the "RERO 21" project. A private law and public interest foundation will be created in 2019 and will gradually replace the current RERO until 2021.

The foundation will provide cantonal, municipal, heritage, legal and school libraries with a new library management system that is free and can be used by both networks and libraries. [SONAR](https://sonar.ch) (Swiss Open Access Repository) is also part of the range of services, which has been established partly in line with RERO's current services.

The new library management system being developed by the team at RERO, in collaboration with the CERN, is based on the [Invenio](https://inveniosoftware.org "Invenio website") framework and will be in operation by the end of 2020. These developments will be presented in March 2019 at the upcoming *Journée RERO*.
