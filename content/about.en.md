In the current context of the changing library landscape in Switzerland, RERO will turn into a competence and service centre for libraries by 2021. This project was approved by RERO's supervisory authority, the [CIIP](https://www.rero.ch/pdfview.php?section=communique&filename=ciip_communique.pdf "CIIP press release"), in september 2018.

This blog aims to publish posts about RERO 21,  grouped under the [RERO 21 label](/tags/rero21), as well as about the different sub-projects that constitute it:

- [RERO ILS](/tags/rero-ils).
- [MEF](/tags/mef).
- SONAR (which has its own [website](https://sonar.ch).

### RERO ILS

Since the end of 2017, the RERO team is developing a free library management system, which will be available as a web service hosted in Martigny. From a technical point of view, RERO ILS is based on the [Invenio](https://invenio-software.org) framework and the experience acquired by the team.

This project, at the heart of RERO 21, is intended to be a system open to both libraries and library networks. It will be operational by the end of 2020. A demonstration system is publicly available at the following address: [ils.test.rero.ch](https://ils.test.rero.ch).

### MEF: Multilingual Entity File

RERO 21 will offer its services throughout Switzerland, which means that RERO ILS must be multilingual. From the authorities' point of view, the challenge is in no way trivial. RERO is exploring the feasibility of a multilingual authority file consisting of the alignment, by means of [VIAF](https://viaf.org), of different national authority files. RERO believes that the MEF can be useful and has decided to develop this service in an open approach and to make it available, for the time being in a test version, at [mef.test.rero.ch](https://mef.test.rero.ch).

### SONAR: Swiss Open Access Repository

The SONAR project is part of the [P-5](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/organisation/projects-and-programmes/p-5/) program of [swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/). It consists in the development of a national institutional archive, which aims to collect, promote and ensure the preservation of open access scientific publications of authors affiliated to public research institutions in Switzerland. SONAR also intends to offer an institutional archive service ("IR as a Service*").
