[RERO](https://www.rero.ch/) is the Library Network of Western Switzerland, with its central office in Martigny, Valais. In the current context of the changing library landscape in Switzerland, RERO is turning into a competence and service centre for libraries by 2021. It will then become a non-profit foundation. This major project is called RERO 21 and has been approved in September 2018 by the RERO's supervisory authority, the [CIIP](https://www.rero.ch/pdfview.php?section=communique&filename=ciip_communique.pdf "Press release of CIIP in PDF").

This blog aims to publish posts about RERO 21, grouped under the [RERO 21 label](/en/tags/rero21), as well as about the different sub-projects that constitute it: RERO ILS, MEF et SONAR.

### RERO ILS

*More info on the [RERO ILS page](/en/reroils/reroils)*

RERO ILS is an open source library management system developed by RERO in collaboration with the [Catholic University of Louvain (UCLouvain)](https://uclouvain.be/). It will be put into production to replace the current system within the framework of the RERO 21 project.

### MEF: *Multilingual Entity File*

*More info on the [MEF page](/en/mef)*

RERO 21 will offer its services throughout Switzerland, which means that RERO ILS must be multilingual. With MEF, RERO has developed a decentralised solution based on the reliability of the authorities and on Linked Data, in order to display data in multiple languages.

### SONAR: *Swiss Open Access Repository*

*More info on the website [sonar.ch](https://sonar.ch/)*

The SONAR project is part of the [P-5](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/organisation/projects-and-programmes/p-5/) program of [swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/). It consists in the development of a national institutional archive, which aims to collect, promote and ensure the preservation of open access scientific publications of authors affiliated to public research institutions in Switzerland. SONAR also intends to offer an institutional archive service ("IR as a Service").
