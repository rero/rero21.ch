Some 40 libraries currently members of RERO have communicated their intention to benefit from the RERO ILS solution, with a go live scheduled for the summer of 2021. Among them, six pilot libraries are collaborating in the participatory development process:

* [Jura Cantonal Library](https://www.jura.ch/occ/bicj)
* [Library of Bulle](https://musee-gruerien.ch/)
* [Public and University Library of Neuchâtel](http://bpun.unine.ch/)
* [Public Library of Delémont](http://www.delemont.ch/fr/Tourisme-culture-et-loisirs/Vie-culturelles/Bibliotheque/Bibliotheque.html)
* [Public Library of La Chaux-de-Fonds](http://cdf-bibliotheques.ne.ch/)
* [Valais Media Library](https://www.mediatheque.ch/)

Complemented by the expertise of the UCLouvain libraries, this user group constitutes the reference base for the orientations of RERO ILS. The development team is very happy to be able to count on this participation!
