RERO ILS is an open source integrated library system (ILS) developed by RERO in collaboration with the [Catholic University of Louvain (UCLouvain)](https://uclouvain.be/). This is a category of software used to manage the day-to-day operations of a library (document acquisitions, lending, cataloguing, searching) and to provide a public interface for users. RERO ILS is intended to enable the management of a library network, but is also suitable for independent libraries.

From a technical point of view, RERO ILS is based on the [Invenio](https://invenio-software.org) framework developed at [CERN](https://home.cern/).

A demonstration system is publicly available at the following address: [ils.test.rero.ch](https://ils.test.rero.ch).

### Context of RERO

RERO ILS represents the backbone of the [RERO 21](/en/about) conversion project.

Based on more than 30 years of experience in the management of a large library network, the RERO central office began the development of RERO ILS in 2017, with the aim of replacing by 2021 the proprietary software currently implemented in the network. Thanks to an open source system, the central office can leverage the full potential of its experts' skills to best meet the current and future needs of its member libraries.

The RERO ILS service offered by RERO is primarily aimed at public, school and heritage libraries and library networks in Switzerland. It is available in French, German, Italian and English.
