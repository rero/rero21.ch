RERO and the foundation that will replace it are non-profit institutions. As such, rates are set to cover costs.

The calculation of the RERO ILS price is based on the library's use of the system. Example of criteria taken into account:

* Number of libraries/sites
* Number of loans
* Number of documents
* Number of orders (acquisition)
* etc.

All modules are available, but a library may choose not to use some of them. The price will therefore be determined according to the use of each feature. The system is degressive for large institutions.

ðŸ’™ RERO is committed to offering transparency and equal treatment to all its partners.
